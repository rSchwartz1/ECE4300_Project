# Raspberry Pi 3b+ Benchmark for Tiny Encryption Algorithm coded in Python and C++

This benchmark tests the performance of a Raspberry Pi 3b+ (MFLOPS, CPI, Avg. Frequency, Avg. Power, etc.) for the Tiny Encryption Algorithm.

This algorithm was coded in Python and C++ and can be found in the repo.

The final analysis can be found in the paper also in the repo.
